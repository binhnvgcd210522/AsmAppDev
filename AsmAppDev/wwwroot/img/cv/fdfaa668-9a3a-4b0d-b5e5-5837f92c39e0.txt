-> I had some plans a few years ago like I'm going on vacation with my family in Hawaii, I'll have an ielts 7.5 when I'm 18. But those plans did not come true because when I was planning to go on vacation, the outbreak of covid-19 made it impossible for me to cancel that plan, and the plan to achieve ielts 7.5 did not come true. because I'm not really good at English and I've taken the test many times and failed, I'm still studying so that the plan will work even though I'm over 18 years old but I'll still try to do it.
